                <p>Meeting Agenda: We will cover beginner to advanced details of HTML5 and CSS3. This meeting will allow us to get everyone caught up and comfortable creating a static website before we move on to creating dynamic websites. Beginner and intermediate students will go though a step-by-step tutorial of creating a full static HTML5 website. Our more advanced students will be learning the ins and outs of Bootstrap.

                <p>Meeting Agenda: We will determine how much experience in web development potential members already have. The content of subsequent meetings will then follow from this initial assessment. Our current plan is to start with tutorials for leading web frameworks such as Ruby on Rails and Django, and build forward from these foundations. Please attend the initial club meeting bringing your ideas, and links to tutorials of web technologies you would like to learn. Pack along your portable device if you have one. Remember, this is your group!</p>
